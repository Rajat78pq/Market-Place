          In the early 1900s, Waikīkī was home to many wetlands, which were
          claimed to harbor disease-carrying mosquitoes. To get rid of the
          mosquitoes, developers created the Ala Wai canal. The canal,
          originally known as the Waikīkī Drainage Canal, was created by a
          Hawaiian dredging company run by Walter F. Dillingham. The project
          took about seven years, 1921–1928.[10] Duke Kahanamoku became a
          well-known surfer in Waikīkī. Throughout his life and after competing
          in the Olympics, many people around the world wanted to learn to surf.
          Duke's influence made Waikīkī beach a surfing hotspot.[11] "Dukes", a
          club in Waikīkī named for Kahanamoku, helped Don Ho produce music and
          hosted the longest-running show in Waikīkī.[12] The first high-rise
          hotels on Waikīkī were built in 1955, including the Waikiki Biltmore
          and Sheraton Princess Kaiulani Hotel. Development boomed due to
          demand, and the area became filled with large resort hotels, such as
          the Hilton Hawaiian Village, Halekulani, the Hyatt Regency Waikiki,
          Marriott Waikiki, Sheraton Waikiki. These complemented historic hotels
          dating back to the early 20th century such as the Moana Surfrider
          Hotel and the Royal Hawaiian Hotel. Changes in the shoreline Waikīkī
          developed erosion problems starting in the late 1800s, as hotels and
          homes were built too close to the natural shoreline, while seawalls
          and other structures blocked the natural ebb and flow of sand along
          the beach.[13] In the 1920s and 1930s, sand was imported from
          Manhattan Beach, California, via ship and barge.[14] Before 1950,
          Waikīkī beaches were continuous. Then seawalls and groins began to
          appear. These helped build sand at one beach, but typically
          appropriated sand from others. They became separated into sections,
          some with sandy beach and others without. By 1950, more than 80
          structures, including seawalls, groins, piers, and storm drains,
          occupied the Waikīkī shoreline.[13] Following World War II, Waikīkī
          beach restoration efforts have occurred every few years. Sand was
          imported to this artificial beach from the 1920s to the 1970s, once by
          boat and barge from Southern California. 1,730 feet (530 m) of
          shoreline was replenished at a cost of $2.4 million following chronic
          erosion of more than a foot a year.[15] Importing stopped in the
          1970s. In March 1971, the Corps of Engineers Pacific Ocean Division,
          created a Draft Environmental Statement for the Kuhio Beach Sector of
          Waikīkī, which aimed to improve the overall quality and size of the
          fading and narrowing shoreline.[16]
